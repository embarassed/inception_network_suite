<h1>Inception Network Suite</h1>

<h4>This project is aimed at replicating various inception network implementations that are presented across many different academic papers. It is done by breaking the modules down into
their basic block structures (stems, modules, classifiers), making it easy to define how to
try out a new architecture</h4>

<h4>This is early in development. So far, only Inception v1 tests are written. Expect a lot more
commits soon</h4>

<h4>Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tensorflow >= 1.0</li>
<li>Numpy >= 1.12></l1>
